      <span class="intro">The school age program is available for children before and/or after school, days off and holidays, school closing and summer. Additional programs are available for school-age children through the age of twelve. Planned activities and secure, large special play areas allow the children the time and space to learn, play, and have fun. Transportation is available to and from many neighboring schools.</span><br>
      <br>

      The program offers the help and time for children to complete homework, art experiences, games and other activities. We understand that children are in a structured environment all day; therefore we provide free choice time to expend energy while providing a productive and safe environment. The children receive an afternoon snack and can choose their activity during free choice time. After free choice, children will go outside and will be encouraged to participate in group outdoor activities or to play in small groups. If parents wish, homework time will be available along with the help to complete it.<br>
      <br>

      <strong class="bluetext">School Age Summer Program/Camp:</strong> We have a wonderful summer program for school aged children where children get to plan the curriculum based on their interests so we know we are offering activities that are exciting to the children. Children are included in planning summer events and field trips. They will be able to participate in special field trips, art projects, and water play, cooking experiences, outside activities, educational activities, special guests, and much more!<br>
