  </div>

  <div class="one-third">

  <div class="one-third last">
    <h4>Additional Charges with advance notification</h4> Special events, programs, field trips, photographs, etc. may require additional fees.

  <div class="spacer"></div>

  <div class="one-third">
    <h4>Finder's Fee</h4> Parents must notify Park's Edge Preschool's office at least one hour prior to their child's scheduled school pick up time or a <strong>$5 "finder's fee"</strong> will be assessed per incident; notify us a.s.a.p. A "finder's fee" is applied in the event Park's Edge Preschool is not notified of a school-age child's absence. It delays our scheduled bus route as we try to locate the missing child and could jeopardize the safety of other children. Safety first at Park's Edge Preschool! Policy also applies to late arrivals after 8:10 am for PEP's a.m. bus transportation.

  <div class="one-third">
    <h4>Early Drop-off</h4> 15 minutes or earlier than regular scheduled drop off time will be charged a <strong>$5.00 fee</strong> without a two-week advance written notice. (Unscheduled early drop off jeopardizes staff/child ratios.)
