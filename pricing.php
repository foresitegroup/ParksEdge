    <div>
      <h4>Family Multiple Child</h4> Two children in attendance at PEP from the same family will receive a <strong>10% discount</strong> on the oldest child. Three children in attendance from the same family will receive a <strong>15% discount</strong> on the oldest child in addition a <strong>10% discount</strong> on the second oldest child.
    </div>

      <h4>Active/Participating Members</h4> of Emanuel United Church of Christ of Hales Corners receive a <strong>10% discount</strong> on weekly tuition.
    </div>

    <div>
      <h4>Military Discount</h4> Children with active or veteran parent receive a <strong>10% discount</strong> on weekly tuition.
    </div>

    <div>
      <h4>Family Referral</h4> PEP offers <strong>$100.00 bonus referral fee</strong> towards tuition to families that refer another family to our center. A referral bonus is applied to referring family's account after referred family is enrolled 90 days.
    </div>

    <div>
      <h4>Credits</h4> You will receive tuition vouchers to be used for vacation, holidays, or illness related absences. Each child will receive 1 full week of the amount of days of their regular weekly attendance at PEP. See parent handbook.
    </div>

    <div>
      <h4>Additional Charges with advance notification</h4> Special events, programs, field trips, photographs, etc. may require additional fees.
    </div>

    <div>
      <h4>Finder's Fee</h4> Parents must notify Park's Edge Preschool's office at least one hour prior to their child's scheduled school pick up time or a <strong>$5 "finder's fee"</strong> will be assessed per incident; notify us a.s.a.p. A "finder's fee" is applied in the event Park's Edge Preschool is not notified of a school-age child's absence. It delays our scheduled bus route as we try to locate the missing child and could jeopardize the safety of other children. Safety first at Park's Edge Preschool! Policy also applies to late arrivals after 8:10 am for PEP's a.m. bus transportation.

      <h4>Early Drop-off</h4> 15 minutes or earlier than regular scheduled drop off time will be charged a <strong>$5.00 fee</strong> without a two-week advance written notice. (Unscheduled early drop off jeopardizes staff/child ratios.)
