      <h2>Our Child Care Programs</h2>
      We have developed programs specifically to meet your family's need. We realize that from the moment of birth, children start to learn and discover the world around them. We offer a series of programs for children age 6 weeks through pre-kindergarten who benefit from the use of a well-defined age appropriate daily curriculum to direct their learning experience.
