      <span class="intro">We provide the best possible care for your child through Christian-based values. At Park's Edge Preschool, Grace is said before meals and bible stories from books and songs are taught within an atmosphere of Christian love and behavior. We do not teach church doctrine, but we do educate every child enrolled at Park's Edge Preschool about the love God has for everyone and the importance of respecting others.</span><br>
      <br>

      <strong class="bluetext">Educational Policy:</strong> We realize that from the moment of birth children start to learn and discover the world around them. As Early Childhood Professionals one of our main goals is to help in providing a foundation for the young child to continue to learn and grow. Our staff provides a warm, nurturing atmosphere where children feel comfortable and confident to explore the world around them with safe limitations. Diversity is a very important element in our program planning. Our teachers plan their own thematic lesson plans for the week (includes the Wisconsin Model Early Learning Standards).<br>
      <br>

      <strong class="bluetext">A Flexible Balance</strong> of active/quiet; individual/group; and indoor/outdoor activities are prepared. Each child is offered free choice play, large and small manipulative activities, nutritious meals and snacks, stories, creative art, music, math, science, sensory experiences, large muscle activities and outdoor play.<br>
      <br>

      <strong class="bluetext">Learning Centers and Activities Offer Opportunities</strong> for social and self-awareness; pre-math, pre-reading, and other cognitive readiness skills; language skills; role-playing and imaginary play; construction and block play experiences.<br>
      <br>

      Developmentally appropriate practices are implemented to challenge each individual child at their own age level and ability. The following needs of each child are promoted and met: self-esteem and positive self-image, social interaction, self-expression and communication skills, creative development, large and small muscle development, intellectual development, and self-help skills.<br>
      <br>

      We stress the importance of play for every child. Although we have structured programs and adhere to a daily schedule we also recognize the utmost importance of free choice play. The learning that is derived from play for the young child is an important element in meeting the needs that make up the whole child by encouraging them to reach their full potential.<br>
      <br>

      <strong class="bluetext">Parent Involvement:</strong> We know that families are the strongest influence on young children and when early childhood educators partner with parents, children excel. Parent input is a key compinent to the program, so we ask our parents to evaluate our program several times a year. Also, parents are strongly encouraged to participate by: volunteering in their child's classroom, chaperoning field trips, participating in center activities and opportunities, annual celebrations (Mother's &amp; Father's Day Breakfast, P.E.P.'s Family Picnic, Open House, Parent-Teacher Conferences, and more).<br>

      <span class="intro">We realize that from the moment of birth children start to learn and discover the world around them. For our toddlers, toilet training and other self-help skills are part of our daily program. The low-turnover of our highly qualified, nuturing staff enhances the environment.</span><br>
      <br>

      <strong class="bluetext">Infant:</strong> Park's Edge Preschool's low-turnover of highly qualified, nurturing staff enhances the environment. The teachers at Park's Edge Preschool understand that infants who receive consistent and loving care will learn to trust their environment. This trust and love, along with safety is our first priority for our infants. We develop our classrooms knowing that every infant sets their own schedule allowing each child's needs to be met immediately in a loving and caring way. Health and safety are a top priority throughout all our classrooms and this begins in the infant room where toy selection to sanitation, food preparation to diaper changing, our immediate attention to health and safety is apparent.<br>
      <br>

      <ul>
        <li>Each child has their own crib and sleeping area.<span class="bluetext">*</span></li>
        <li>Toys and equipment in your child's classroom are selected specifically to stimulate your child's development.<span class="bluetext">*</span></li>
        <li>Our teachers are specifically trained to work with children under two years old; They will engage in activities to stimulate your child such as: singing, finger plays, block play, dramatic play, and sensory experiences.</li>
        <li>Individual lesson plans are followed for each individual child based on the developmental level of the child.</li>
        <li>Parents will be encouraged to discuss their child's progress on a regular basis.</li>
        <li>The children go outside daily (weather permitting) to engage in a variety of sensory experiences; Outdoors, the teacher will interact with the children, inviting them to experience nature as they explore their outside world.</li>

      <strong class="bluetext">Toddler:</strong> years are marked by many important transitions that continue the lifelong task of learning to separate from home and connect to the larger world. As infants become toddlers, the number of separations and connections increase, requiring children to practice and perfect the important task of transitioning among and between many different settings, experiences, and interactions. Your toddler will follow a daily routine throughout the day, which will promote security in their environment. They will engage in an array of opportunities including circle time, dramatic play, sensory and art experiences, construction and building, small motor, games, outdoor activities, and very importantly, child initiated play. Children learn through play, and allowing them to explore their environment while offering developmentally appropriate activities will teach cooperation, socialization skills and will foster a positive self-image. The classroom will consistently have a theme-based weekly lesson plan posted so the parents are aware of the activities and can discuss them with their child. When children show their readiness, and both the parents and teachers agree it's time for potty training, we will incorporate it into our daily schedule. The parents and teachers will decide together on the steps that will be taken to help the children with this process.<br>

      <span class="intro">We offer programs for children age 2 through pre-kindergarten age. The children benefit from the use of well-defined age appropriate daily curriculum that direct their learning experience. These experiences are, in turn, enhanced by the Christian values environment that is the core of the Park's Edge Preschool and it's caring teachers. Activities include block building, creative arts, library and language sensory wet and dry, music, movement, woodworking and much more. Each day offers opportunities for the preschool child to learn through play.</span><br>
      <br>

      Children learn by doing, therefore our classrooms are set up to create a supportive and interesting environment that promotes learning. Park's Edge Preschool knows the importance of developing the "whole child", including socio-emotional development, cognitive development, and large motor development. All of these important parts of development will be taken into consideration when developing Developmentally Appropriate Curriculum. The play you see your child participating in while at school today influences the development of the basic foundation for life-long learning. Children need to learn at their own pace; all children do not learn the same way or at the same time. Good habits and attitudes are being developed, which will make a difference throughout their lives.<br>
      <br>

      <strong class="bluetext">Some of the goals we focus on attaining with each child are:</strong> problem solving, classifying objects (pre-reading), expansion of verbal skills, acquiring love of books, experience a sense of self-esteem, exhibit a positive attitude toward life, to demonstrate cooperative, pro-social behavior, enhance and refine fine and large motor skills, to use all senses in learning, acquire beginning writing skills, and develop beginning reading skills. By offering a variety of experiences along with introducing new skills, children will learn to love learning, which is the first step in growth.<br>
      <br>

      We ensure that children are exposed to all necessary skills that are required for entrance to kindergarten. The early  childhood experts teach us "abstract, rote learning is not appropriate for young children." Just because children can learn these skills does not mean that they understand them. If we want children to be successful in school now and in the future, we have to teach them to think, to solve problems, and to get along with others. These abilities are acquired when children are encouraged to explore their environment actively, to solve real problems, that have meaning for them, and to work cooperatively with others to complete tasks. This is what you see when you walk in and see the children "playing".<br>
      <br>

      Children will be exposed to reading, writing, and phonics, through a print rich environment, letter of the week, beginning to practice writing their name, recognizing letters and numbers, sequencing, and lots of books!<br>

      <span class="intro">The school age program is available for children before and/or after school, days off and holidays, school closing and summer. Additional programs are available for school-age children through the age of twelve. Planned activities and secure, large special play areas allow the children the time and space to learn, play, and have fun. Transportation is available to and from many neighboring schools.</span><br>
      <br>

      The program offers the help and time for children to complete homework, art experiences, games and other activities. We understand that children are in a structured environment all day; therefore we provide free choice time to expend energy while providing a productive and safe environment. The children receive an afternoon snack and can choose their activity during free choice time. After free choice, children will go outside and will be encouraged to participate in group outdoor activities or to play in small groups. If parents wish, homework time will be available along with the help to complete it.<br>
      <br>

      <strong class="bluetext">School Age Summer Program/Camp:</strong> We have a wonderful summer program for school aged children where children get to plan the curriculum based on their interests so we know we are offering activities that are exciting to the children. Children are included in planning summer events and field trips. They will be able to participate in special field trips, art projects, and water play, cooking experiences, outside activities, educational activities, special guests, and much more!<br>
