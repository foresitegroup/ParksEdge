      <span class="intro">We realize that from the moment of birth children start to learn and discover the world around them. For our toddlers, toilet training and other self-help skills are part of our daily program. The low-turnover of our highly qualified, nuturing staff enhances the environment.</span><br>

      <strong class="bluetext">Infant:</strong> Park's Edge Preschool's low-turnover of highly qualified, nurturing staff enhances the environment. The teachers at Park's Edge Preschool understand that infants who receive consistent and loving care will learn to trust their environment. This trust and love, along with safety is our first priority for our infants. We develop our classrooms knowing that every infant sets their own schedule allowing each child's needs to be met immediately in a loving and caring way. Health and safety are a top priority throughout all our classrooms and this begins in the infant room where toy selection to sanitation, food preparation to diaper changing, our immediate attention to health and safety is apparent.<br>
      <br>

      <ul>
        <li>Each child has their own crib and sleeping area.<span class="bluetext">*</span></li>
        <li>Toys and equipment in your child's classroom are selected specifically to stimulate your child's development.<span class="bluetext">*</span></li>
        <li>Our teachers are specifically trained to work with children under two years old; They will engage in activities to stimulate your child such as: singing, finger plays, block play, dramatic play, and sensory experiences.</li>
        <li>Individual lesson plans are followed for each individual child based on the developmental level of the child.</li>
        <li>Parents will be encouraged to discuss their child's progress on a regular basis.</li>
        <li>The children go outside daily (weather permitting) to engage in a variety of sensory experiences; Outdoors, the teacher will interact with the children, inviting them to experience nature as they explore their outside world.</li>
      </ul>

      <em class="bluetext footnote">* Sheets are changed regularly, cribs are santized weekly, toys are santized daily.</em><br>

      <strong class="bluetext">Toddler:</strong> years are marked by many important transitions that continue the lifelong task of learning to separate from home and connect to the larger world. As infants become toddlers, the number of separations and connections increase, requiring children to practice and perfect the important task of transitioning among and between many different settings, experiences, and interactions. Your toddler will follow a daily routine throughout the day, which will promote security in their environment. They will engage in an array of opportunities including circle time, dramatic play, sensory and art experiences, construction and building, small motor, games, outdoor activities, and very importantly, child initiated play. Children learn through play, and allowing them to explore their environment while offering developmentally appropriate activities will teach cooperation, socialization skills and will foster a positive self-image. The classroom will consistently have a theme-based weekly lesson plan posted so the parents are aware of the activities and can discuss them with their child. When children show their readiness, and both the parents and teachers agree it's time for potty training, we will incorporate it into our daily schedule. The parents and teachers will decide together on the steps that will be taken to help the children with this process.<br>
